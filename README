mouseDialog - dialogs - jQuery plugin

mouseyDialog attempts to solve the dialog issue while keeping things simple. The only things required to use it are:

1. An anchor with an href book mark
2. A corresponding ID on an element

The CSS is left to your own design. mouseyDialog only adds position declarations to the dialog.
